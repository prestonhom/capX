## INTRODUCTION

It shouldnâ€™t cost money to send money around the world nor should anyone have to pay to send money in the age of digital globalization.  With the advent of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, transactions should either be sent free or with the lowest rate possible. The annual remittance market costs the world $50 billion annually and the majority of that stems from the poorest of countries, according to Statista. 

CapX bridges this divide by allowing its users to perform borderless, secure, and data-decentralized transactions.
